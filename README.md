# Ciphering-using-Maple
Cryptography is the method of protecting information through the use of codes applied on it. Cryptography is one of the most important applications of Number Theory and it has been developed since a very long time (Romans 100 B.C.). Since then, many attempts have been made to try to develop a ciphering or encryption technique that cannot be easily decrypted.
The aim of this project is to introduce you to cryptography, you are asked to define one of the cryptography techniques that has been invented by computer engineers and/or mathematicians. But the cryptography technique that you are supposed to define is ciphered using The Affine Cipher Cryptography which has the form 𝑓(𝑝)=(𝑎𝑝+𝑏) (𝑚𝑜𝑑27)
## Steps:
- Download Maple software through (https://www.maplesoft.com/products/maple/free-trial/) using your name, institute and e-mail as you will be given a purchase code valid for two weeks trial for students.
- Read the file “Discrete Math Project Example” as an example that explains Affine Cipher for English Language on Maplesoft.
- Make a Maplesoft file that implements
  - Affine Cipher for Another language for the project text and keys assigned to your group.
  - Affine Decipher for the English language for the project text and keys assigned to you.
  - Commented text that explains the disadvantages of this ciphering techniques.
